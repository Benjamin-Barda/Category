/**
 *Contains the interface Category that provides the necessary structure to build a <b>category</b>.&nbsp;<br>
 *In category theory, a category is just a labeled, directed graph with some extra constraints.&nbsp;<br>
 *Each of the nodes is called an <b>object</b>, and each of the edges is called a <b>morphism</b>.&nbsp;<br>
 * In order for a graph to be considered a category, each object has a morphism pointing at itself,
 * the <i>identity</i> morphism, and morphisms must be able to be <i>composed associatively</i>.
